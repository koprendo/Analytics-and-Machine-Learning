This directory contains K-Means clustering experiments built on synthetic datasets.  
The goal is to demonstrate clustering fundamentals, model behavior, and evaluation techniques using controlled data distributions.

Current contents:
- 2D K-Means clustering with synthetic data generation
- 3D K-Means clustering with synthetic data generation
- Elbow method for optimal cluster number selection
- Model training and cluster assignment using the fit() bound method
- Cluster prediction for unseen samples using the predict() bound method
- Cluster visualization including centroid positions

Planned additions:
- Detailed explanations of fit() and predict() workflows
- High-dimensional K-Means examples (3+ features)
- Dimensionality reduction based visualization (e.g., PCA)
- Silhouette score analysis for cluster quality evaluation

Planned improvements:
- OOP-oriented implementation notes
- Clear explanation of model fitting vs inference phases
- Notebook structure improvements for better readability
