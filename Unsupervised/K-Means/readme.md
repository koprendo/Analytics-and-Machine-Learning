This directory contains K-Means clustering examples built on synthetic datasets.

Currently included:
- 2D K-Means with synthetic data generation
- 3D K-Means with synthetic data generation
- Elbow method for selecting the number of clusters
- Model training and cluster assignment with fit bound method
- Bound method of predict applied on unseen data points 
- Cluster visualizations with centroids

Planned additions:
- Explanatory comments for fit and predict workflows
- High-dimensional (3+ features) K-Means examples
- Visualization of high-dimensional clustering using dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA)
- silhoutte score

Planned adjustments:
- OOP related explanatory notes
- More explanations for train, test and prediction part of the notebook
